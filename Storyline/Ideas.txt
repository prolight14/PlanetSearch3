In this world when you are born you are raised and when you are old enough you are set out on an adventure. In your adventure you are searching for a place that only
the bravest and one that has passed many trials and traveled very far can find or enter. This place is like heaven or Eden and may be known by another name only passed down
by legend only told by knights in the farthest corners of this world. 

If you die all hope is lost (and you have to start over from the beginning) but if you live... and find this place of Eden peace and safety will be yours forever.


Path (1): 
After you are born you are raised by skilled blacksmiths, archers and knights in a kingdom that's (mostly) safe. They teach you the skills to complete your trials that you will 
face when you are much older. There are also bosses you will have to defeat.
