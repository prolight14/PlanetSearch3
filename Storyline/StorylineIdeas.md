The game starts with a cutscene. Princess Isabella is stuck in a cave but she doesn't know where she is. Talon has trapped her there. I also can't explain how she got there. There's blue glowing lights like blue fireflies, green grass, lots of detail everywhere and lots of caverns with flowing water in the background. A stream flows to other parts of the cavern some of which you can't get through and there's strange flowers in the cave that are green with pink petals. Don't forget that the cave is very lush. The princess has a bird (maybe a bunny or some other small animal) with her and it can talk which is pretty cool.

What you don't know is that that bird is actually Isabella's mother, well sort of (more on that later) and Helix (the main character) has another companion creature and when the two creatures unite they form Isabella's mother.

Isabella's father's location is unknown but can be found later in the game. He's not Talon though.
In the game you get to play as her to help her escape (but she never does, at least on her own).  


The realm of ancients has the key to unlocking Talon's location in Dimension X or really traveling to dimension X.
There are 7 heroes that died in age past that are used to unlock the princess's location.

Back when you sent Talon to Dimension X you gave him power you fool. In Dimension X 
Talon has the ability to send a virus to a planet. 



When captain Fleep lost Talon, He went off and started the space pirate clan and pilaged satilites and destyroyed ships.
Also, Leopard X got the Omega(something) to build and protect a device that could "save" Talon From Dimension X.



Story Idea 2 (probably more proper):

After returning the 4 crystals from Amber back to Titan something disturbing happened. For some reason Titan was torn apart and then the 4 crystals were sent to 4 other planets (or dwarf or moon planets)








Titan fell apart and each of the four crystals at their location underground in each temple inside Titan were blasted to other planets (or moons/dwarf planets). What's left of Titan is not much but an energy field has surrounded the planet protecting it from further damage. Titan was a planet with a very special core and without the crystals stablizing it (they still stablize the universe but not for much longer since they are at their temporary or "backup" locations on planets, dwarf planets, or moons in very far regions of space), the planet 



Story Idea 3 (waaayyyyy better and more realistic):

Note: Make it Asian?
WOAH this is a LOT more organized than ^that^ mess!

Titan was a very special planet with a core of a dying blue neutron star and the only thing that kept it together (and the neutron star from dying) was 4 crystals, those crystals 
were later moved somehow to a planet called Amber from 3 areas, Ninja Temple (protected by Ninjas and a Ninja boss, tricked by Talon), Icy Caverns (protected by an Ice Dragon, again tricked by Talon) and DEEP (Depth of Exotic Electrial Pathways, guarded by Captain Fleep who was sent by Talon) and for the last crystal Talon stole that one and used it for himself for evil. Earlier though, those 4 crystals weren't always on Amber because they belonged on Titan. 

The Ancients from the Realm of Ancients created a hypercrystal when they discovered that something was very wrong with the universe an even more ancient power that was there before them, maybe even almost at the beginning of time or the beginning of the universe. This dark power, no one knows where it came from. But the Ancients do know one thing: 
it's power grows all the time, slowly eating away at the core of every planet turning each planet into a virus planet. This hypercrystal was placed on Titan as a beacon of power 
to banish all the dark energy in the universe into Dimension X.

That's why the Ancients created the hypercrystal but then a bit later aliens battled for 1,000 years for control of it with only one race coming out on top with a leader named Talon though some aliens in other races that battled for the crystal also joined Talon to form a small team with Talon as their leader.

More recently someone has gotten back into control of this dark power and has harnessed it to change a crystal into a "dark energy" one so it can turn a planet into a virus planet.
This person was Talon. It is still unexplained how he did this and his backstory is completely unexplained. Talon has already destroyed one planet called Search. He will likely destroy many more planets with this dark energy crystal.

When Helix finally defeated Talon and locked him away in Dimension X and finally returned the 3 crystals to their locations on Titan it was already too late for Titan. Titan, 
without having the crystals to stablize its core blasted apart sending the 3 crystals to 3 locations which each were either a planet, a Dwarf planet, or a moon and Titan's core or 
neutron star collapsed into a blackhole which formed a portal to the Realm of Ancients. The reason the crystals were blasted to other planets is because without the crystals in a 
safe place the universe will become unstable.

With Talon in Dimension X, he is now in power of the dark energy in that dimension, since he has wielded this power before he know how to "break" dimensions and send power through
rifts in spacetime which he can also use to commumicate to his minions (which are Captain Fleep and Leopard X). But not enough to get himself free.

The Realm of Ancients, being a very sacred place had the power to protect itself from evil entering it because of this a field preventing anything from even getting near the 
remains of the planet of Titan formed. Cosmic Dragons were sent out of the Realm of Ancients to further ensure the safety of the realm. The Cosmic Dragons breathed nebula gas all 
over around the remains of Titan. Cosmic Dragons can feed on stars and cosmic dust and the dust scatters and disrupts all forms of communication, mapping systems, and transmission systems. These dragons will also die if led into a black hole. This was an 2,000 year old plan to protect the realm if anything like this ever happened.

There is a way to get back into Dimension X if for whatever reason you'd need to. In the Realm of Ancients, there are 7 pillars. In each pillar there is an empty slot for a 
galactic pendant. Each pendant belongs to a hero. All of these heroes have gone their separate ways in the universe, thankfully in the Realm of Ancients there are a few things Helix can do to get 3 of these pendants. The other pendants the player will have to search the universe for and THIS is why it's called "Planet Search" because you are searching the planets for orbs, heroes and much more.

This 2,000 year old plan created by the Ancients can't last forever though. Eventually the Cosmic Dragons will run out of cosmic dust and stars to feed on that's just around the 
remains of Titan and will slowly spread to other parts of the galaxy and breathing more nebula gas slowly destroying the universe. But that's not the only problem (and the least 
of our concerns), since the planets (and moons and dwarf planets) that the crystals were sent to don't have a core of a blue neutron star and that they are too far away and 
blocked by the energy field around the remains of Titan they won't receive that power and will eventually fade away and disappear forever. The only reason why they survived on Amber for so long is because Amber is the ONLY other planet with anything close to such a neutron star core.
